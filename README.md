## What is RedGerm?

RedGerm is a full-stack, domain-heavy agriculture platform that replaces fragmented spreadsheets and disconnected tools with one structured, evidence-based workflow. It connects every stage of a breeding program: from registering raw genetic material to releasing a variety — with full traceability at every step.

**The complete chain:**

```
Material → Breeding Unit → Crossing → Trial → Selection → Harvest → Seed Inventory → Variety Decision
```

No broken links. No data loss across generations. No spreadsheet chaos.

---

## Core Features

### 🧬 Breeding Management

**Plant Material Registry**
Register incoming seed accessions with full metadata — crop, generation (F1–F99 and BC series), pollination type, supported breeding methods (SSD, Pedigree, Bulk, Backcross, and more). Each material gets an auto-generated structured code (`TOM-M-001`).

**Breeding Units (Known Lineage)**
When a plant is harvested from a trial, the system automatically creates a Breeding Unit with traceable parentage. Generation is auto-incremented using a smart algorithm that handles F-series, BC-series, and nested generations correctly.

**Family Tree & Lineage**
Interactive visual family tree powered by React Flow and dagre layout. Navigate the full ancestry chain from any node — material, breeding unit, or seed lot. Nodes show live stock availability. Click any ancestor to jump to its detail page.

**Crossing Module**
Record hybridization crosses with parent compatibility validation, execution tracking, pollination method, and result recording. Crosses automatically feed into the lineage graph.

---

### 🌾 Field Trial Lifecycle

**7-Step Setup Wizard**
A guided wizard that structures trial creation from start to publish:
1. Trial information (crop, season, location, breeding method)
2. Entities — link materials/BUs with seed lots from inventory
3. Trial design — CRD, RCBD, Alpha Lattice, Split Plot, Augmented, P-Rep, or Custom
4. Plant map generation with automatic layout per design type
5. Visit schedule planning
6. Label printing
7. Publish to execution

**Experimental Design Engine**
Built-in support for standard agricultural trial designs with randomization:
- **CRD** — Completely Randomized Design (homogeneous environments)
- **RCBD** — Randomized Complete Block Design (field gradients)
- **Alpha Lattice** — for large entry counts
- **Split Plot** — two-factor experiments
- **Augmented** — new entries + replicated checks
- **P-Rep** — partially replicated designs
- **Custom** — manual row-by-row entry assignment

**Plant-Level Execution**
Each plant gets a unique code (`TR-2024-001-R01-P001`) with a QR label. During execution, engineers observe and score traits plant by plant — from a map view or via QR scan. Observations respect trait data types: numeric inputs, percentage sliders, boolean toggles, select dropdowns, and free text.

**Disease & Stress Recording**
Select from a structured Pest & Disease Library (general or crop-specific) with severity scales (1–5 or 1–9 IPGRI standard) and incidence percentage per plant per visit.

**Daily Environmental Logs**
Log temperature (max/min), humidity, soil EC, soil pH, rainfall, and notes per trial day — with photo upload.

---

### 📊 Selection & Analytics

**Selection Algorithm**
Set standard trait criteria with target values, direction (max/min/exact), and weights. The system calculates a weighted similarity score for every active plant and ranks them. Engineers review the ranked list, select manually or by threshold, and confirm. Non-selected plants are automatically marked as dropped.

**Breeding Analytics**
Trait distribution analysis, generation comparison across breeding cycles, segregation pattern visualization, and heritability insights — built for making evidence-based advancement decisions.

---

### 🌍 Variety Catalog & Evaluation

**Public Variety System**
Breeding engineers can request to publish a variety. After admin approval, it enters the public catalog where field trial engineers and external evaluators can access it.

Three visibility levels: `Private → Public → Released`

**Evaluation Trial System**
A simplified but complete trial system for field trial engineers evaluating named varieties. Supports multi-location comparison of the same variety across environments.

**External Evaluator Portal**
Restricted portal for external evaluators — they see only assigned public varieties, submit evaluations, and upload photos. No access to breeding data.

**Variety Advancement Pipeline**
Compile evaluation results, compute performance summaries, and make structured `Continue / Drop / Adopt` decisions backed by data.

---

### 🗄️ Seed Inventory & Storage

**Storage Mapping**
Define storage locations (freezers, cold rooms, dry stores, cabinets) with shelves and slots. Slot occupancy is computed dynamically — no stale flags.

**Seed Lots**
Each lot carries: source material/BU, quantity (grams or seed count — not both forced), germination %, purity %, harvest date, expiry date, supplier info, and storage slot assignment.

**Transaction Ledger**
Every movement is recorded: initial receipt, returns, and disposals. Running balance is maintained per transaction. No transaction can be soft-deleted — the audit trail is permanent.

**Inventory Reports**
Current stock, movement history, low stock alerts, expiry alerts, and a visual storage map showing what's in every slot.

---

### 🤖 AI Integration

RedGerm integrates with an AI gateway for:
- **Report generation** — AI-assisted narrative reports from trial and harvest data
- **Smart suggestions** — contextual hints during trial setup and wizard steps
- **Operational workflows** — AI-enabled actions embedded in the platform

---

### 🖨️ Printing Stack

**ZPL Label Printing**
Direct thermal printing via QZ Tray agent (installed locally on engineer's machine). Supports any ZPL-compatible printer (Zebra, TSC, Godex, Bixolon, and others). Label size is configurable: 30×20mm, 40×25mm, 50×30mm, 60×40mm, or custom dimensions. DPI-aware dot calculation.

**PDF Fallback**
A4 label grid PDF for engineers without a thermal printer. Server-side generation via DomPDF with embedded QR codes.

**Seed Passport PDF**
Formal A4 document for any seed lot — source, lineage chain, storage location, quantities, germination, expiry, and origin trial.

**Trial Report PDF**
Full trial report: summary, entities, field layout, environmental data, visit summary, trait statistics, disease summary, selection results, harvest output, and photo gallery.

---

### 🔐 Governance & Security

**Role-Based Access Control**
Fine-grained permissions via Spatie Laravel Permission. Roles include: Admin, Researcher, Breeding Engineer, Field Trial Engineer, Evaluator, and Viewer. Every route is permission-guarded.

**Data Isolation**
Each user sees only their own data by default. Admins see all. Public varieties are selectively visible based on approval status. No cross-user data leakage.

**Audit Trail**
Centralized audit log for sensitive actions — who did what, when, from where. Includes browser and OS fingerprint.

**Lock Screen**
Fast re-entry flow for shared workstations. After inactivity, the screen locks and the known user is prompted for password only — no need to re-enter email.

**No Public Registration**
Account creation is admin-controlled only. No self-signup endpoint exists.

---

### ⚡ Performance & Field Readiness

**PWA Support**
Full Progressive Web App with service worker and manifest. Engineers can install RedGerm on tablets and use it offline in the field. QR scanning works from the installed app.

**QR Scanning**
Camera-based QR scanning built into the observation workspace. Engineers scan a plant's label → jump directly to its observation form. Manual fallback input included.

**Bilingual (Arabic / English)**
Full RTL/LTR runtime switching. Every label, error, and tooltip is translated. Direction switches instantly without reload.

**Autosave**
Trial wizard steps autosave on field blur. Engineers never lose progress mid-setup.
